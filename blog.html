        <h2> 1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
        <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. all HTML webpages are referred to as documents.
            <br> The purpus of Document Object Model represents each of these web pages in a tree-like structure to make
            it easier to access and manage the elements.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h2>
        <p>Ans : To select HTML elements using the DOM, you can use a variety of methods such as getElementById(),
            getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName(), querySelector(), and querySelectorAll(). These methods
            allow you to
            select specific elements based on their ID, class name, tag name, or CSS selector. Once you have selected an
            element,
            you can manipulate its content, attributes, and styles using various DOM properties and methods.</p>
        <h2>3. What is event bubble?</h2>
        <p>Ans : Event bubbling is a mechanism in the DOM where events triggered on a child element will "bubble
            up" through its parent
            elements all the way to the document object, unless they are stopped or prevented from doing so. When an
            event is
            triggered on an element, it is first handled by that element's event handler, and then propagated to its
            parent
            element's event handler, and so on, until it reaches the top-level document object or until an event
            listener stops it.</p>
        <h2>4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
        <p>Ans : A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, which is
            expected to call back
            (execute) the argument function at some point.

            The purpose of a callback function is to allow a function to call back to the caller with a result or
            status, or to
            perform some additional operations. Callback functions are commonly used in event-driven programming and
            asynchronous
            programming.</p>
